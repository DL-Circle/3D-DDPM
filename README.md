# 3D-DDPM 🌐
🙇‍♂️ Greetings, we apologize for the delay in releasing our code, which was due to the journal submission process. We appreciate your interest and patience in waiting for our work. 🚀
🌟 We have released our code along with our improved model for semantic 3D image synthesis in our new repository, '[mobaidoctor](https://github.com/mobaidoctor/med-ddpm)'. This repository will serve as the central hub for all our future works. 
🔍 We invite you to visit this repository to explore our code and latest developments. You have the option to train models in both unconditional and conditional ways. 
📝 Our work is currently under review, and once it is accepted by a journal, we plan to release additional models. 

🎉 Wishing you a Happy New Year in advance.
